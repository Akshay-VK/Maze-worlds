# Maze Worlds

## The Idea

#### The game is a 2D RPG.
#### It is set in a infinite world which is a maze.

## The development theory

#### For my last game, a serious problem I faced was performance. The game was barely running at 60fps.

#### So, this time, im going to use multiple canvases! They will be:

#### >Background: Updated only when required
#### >Characters: Updated everytime
#### >Lights: Updated every time

#### You might ask, why not use WebGL. Truth is, it is VERY diffucult(for me).I'm learning it though.
